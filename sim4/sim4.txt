The extra instructions I decided to implement were ANDI, BNE, and SLL.

For ANDI implementation I added a proper opcode and made it so that the immediate value would always be
zero extended. For BNE I added an opcode if else block and a new alu op. Additionally for SLL added valid
opcode as well.
